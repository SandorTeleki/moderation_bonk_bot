Moderation Bonk Bot
WIP

To Do:
- Tracking of users who have the 'watchlist' role (or allow for role to be set programmatically)
- /help command (maybe have a version for those who can actually use bot and for those who can't? "Pray you never get bonked by me!")
- sqlite3 to store daily quota (default "0", which means no message limit)
- sqlite3 to store users on the watchlist and how many messages they sent in a given calendar day (UTC)
- sqlite3 for moderation logs (who use which command when)
- write a proper README.md...
